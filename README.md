# K-Means-Clustering
K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible. A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.
